"""Set up the pinned MinGW-w64 that wgrender builds with on Windows, and print its bin.

    tools/setup_mingw.py

On a Windows host, the windows-x64-mingw presets' toolchain file (cmake/mingw-w64.cmake)
runs this and compiles with the gcc it names, so a MinGW build is the one wgrender is
tested with, never whichever gcc another tool put on PATH. It is a WinLibs release
(standalone GCC and MinGW-w64, no installer), downloaded once, checked against its
SHA-256, and unpacked into the per-user cache (tools/hostcache.py:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\wgrender\\mingw\\<release>). It prints that release's bin on stdout;
progress goes to stderr. Run again, it only prints. To move to a newer release, change
RELEASE, URL, and SHA256 below together, from the release's page. Ported from libwgt's.
Standard library only; Python 3.9 or later.
